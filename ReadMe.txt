My third project ever, implemented more clean code techniques. Implemented more JS and some JQuery, added FontAwesome 
for my icons and Owl Carousel, you know...for carousels.
First time using SVG and external fonts. 
This is a clone-like template that has been circulating the internet for a couple of years, so far this has been the most code-intensive
template I ever made cuz I had to make 4 pages in total it took me like <11hrs I guess. Hope you like it and wish me luck hopefully
I make better templates :D
